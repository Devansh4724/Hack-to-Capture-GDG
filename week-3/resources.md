# Week-3 : Cryptography
There are many types of cryptography techniques some common ones are mentioned here -
- [Base encoding](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/base-what-a-practical-introduction-to-base-encoding--net-27590)
- [Vigenere cipher](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vigenere-cipher/)
- [Caesar cipher](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/caesar-cipher-in-cryptography/)
- [Morse code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8tPkb98Fkk)
- [Hashing Functions](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography/cryptography_hash_functions.htm)

To start with cryptography you can start with the following **cryptohack** modules :
- [Introduction to Cryptography](https://cryptohack.org/courses/intro/course_details/)
- [Modular Arithmetic](https://cryptohack.org/courses/intro/course_details/)

Let us proceed to one of the more practical aspect of cryptography Public Key Cryptography
- [Public-Key Cryptography](https://cryptohack.org/courses/public-key/course_details/) are excellent for getting familiar with the different public key methods.
- Read some basic attacks on the RSA cryptosystem(Wienerâ€™s attack, Low public exponent attack, Partial key exposure, etc) For more attacks, check the RSA section of the following page:
https://github.com/jvdsn/crypto-attacks and try googling the attack to know more about it.

Some bit harder topics
- [Symmetric Cryptography](https://cryptohack.org/courses/symmetric/course_details/) 

- [Elliptic Curve Cryptography](https://cryptohack.org/courses/elliptic/course_details/)


For more practice, you can also practice sets from [cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/).
