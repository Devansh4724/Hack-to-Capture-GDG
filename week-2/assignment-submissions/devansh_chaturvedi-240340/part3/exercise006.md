It was posted on X by Tajuden Sorush on 19-01-2023. First searched the image on google images. And got the following info:

```bash
Description	A Vehicle Born Improvised Explosive Devise (VBIED) after exploding on a street outside of the Al Sabah newspaper office in the Waziryia district of Baghdad, Iraq. The VBIED destroyed more than 20 cars, killing two people and wounding as many as 30.
Date	27 August 2006

So, the claim made by the journalist is wrong. This image is from Baghdad, Iraq and was clicked on 27 August 2006 by the US Navy.
