# OSINT Exercise #008

First used Google lens to scan the image and narrowed down on the possible halls where this event was held.

```bash
The crowd is applauding at performance of Shen Yun (Translated the text on newspaper using Google)
Date: 07-01-2023 (Checked out the article related to this event at the website of the newspaper agency)
Venue: Chrysler Hall, Norfolk Virginia (Looks similar to Jones Hall. But the difference lies at the structure of seats at 1st and 2nd floor)
```
