# OSINT Exercise #003

First used Google lens and saw that the Turkish president received several other international guests at that same place. After searching "Where does the Turkish president receive the guests" on Google, I got to know its name. After further searching on google, I got to know the address and coordinates.

```bash
Place: Presidential Complex of Turkey (Address: Beştepe Cd. & Cumhurbaşkanlığı Blv, Beştepe, 06560 Yenimahalle/Ankara, Türkiye)
Coordinates: Latitude: 39.9247778 Longitude: 32.8059864
