 Searched in google earth for the location "Kiffa" written in the image given in the challenge.  
Got it as a city in Mauritania  
Saw date of the tweet as 20th Feb,2013  
Opened the 2013 map of Kiffa in google earth  
The shadows in the image are towards right and its given in the tweet that it is morning. Sun rises from east so the road must lead towards south.  
Towards south we can see a nice amount of greenery.  
The road seems lead towards end of city as a little houses are visible in the image.  
Road is wide and black seeing the roads of Kiffa this seems to be a main road.  
Analysing all factors and trying to find in the map. Looked for the same structure of two buildings and a tree got the location as ``` 16°36'34"N 11°23'52"W```
