## Challenge 9

I opened the file on audacity and tried tweaking various possibilites like reversing the audio , spilliting tracks and keeping one flppped and the other as it is to cancel out common noise . Also treid to read the spectrogram but no avail.

Also tried the usual stegno tools like binwalk, xxd but couldnt find anything else
