2.⁠ ⁠*Website Investigation*  
•⁠  ⁠Visiting the Epoch Times website (https://www.epochtimes.com/) and searching *“Hinterseer”* revealed multiple articles mentioning the same name.  
•⁠  ⁠One article from *January 8, 2023, showed the **same photo* from the task, identifying the event as a *Shen Yun performance* by their North America company.  

3.⁠ ⁠*Image Search for Confirmation*  
•⁠  ⁠A reverse image search of the task photo led to an article on *Minghui.org* ([source](https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2023/1/13/206159.html)), featuring the *exact task photo*.  
•⁠  ⁠The article mentions *Shen Yun North America Company at Chrysler Hall, Norfolk, Virginia, on **January 7, 2023*.
