## OSINT Exercise 006 - Writeup  

### Goal: Verify the authenticity of an image used in a tweet about a Khyber, Pakistan attack.  

---

### Approach  

1.⁠ ⁠*Verifying the Report of the Attack*  
•⁠  ⁠A Google search of the tweet’s headline confirmed the report of the Khyber attack.  
•⁠  ⁠Articles from [The News](https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1032268-khyber-agency) and [Mashaal Radio](https://www.mashaalradio.com/a/three-policemen-killed-in-suicide-attack-in-khyber/32230945.html) confirmed the attack occurred, but no matching image was used in these reports.  

2.⁠ ⁠*Reverse Image Lookup*  
•⁠  ⁠A reverse image search of the blast photo led to multiple results.   
•⁠  ⁠The same photo was used in articles such as one from [Asharq Al-Awsat](https://english.aawsat.com/home/article/2549496/18-killed-bombing-turkish-controlled-syrian-town) reporting a 2020 bombing in Syria.  
•⁠  ⁠Another significant result was a [Wikipedia file](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:WaziriyaAutobombeIrak.jpg) that traces the photo’s origin back to *August 2006 in Iraq*.  

---

### Conclusion  
•⁠  ⁠*The attack in Khyber, Pakistan (January 2023) happened, but the image used in the tweet was misleading and unrelated.*  
•⁠  ⁠The photo is an old archive from a 2006 bombing in Iraq, not from the 2023 event in Pakistan.

### Final Answer  
•⁠  ⁠*The journalist's tweet used a misleading image unrelated to the Khyber attack.*
