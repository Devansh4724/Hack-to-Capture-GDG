## Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Reverse Image Search**:
   - Performed a reverse image search to identify the key elements in the photograph. The large, angular metal sculpture stood out, which I identified as **"Homem-Sol"** by Portuguese artist **Jorge Vieira**.
   - This led to the location being **Centro Vasco de Gama** in Lisbon, confirmed through various sources and matching architectural features.

2. **Geolocation**:
   - Used **Google Street View** to pinpoint the exact location. By matching the visual elements in the photo (like the sculpture and surrounding architecture), I was able to identify the coordinates as **38.767624째, -9.096078째**.

3. **Determining the Year**:
   - The poster in the image advertised the *Tutankhamun* exhibition, which took place in **Lisbon in both 2017 and 2019**.
   - I reviewed YouTube videos of the exhibition and found one that confirmed the exhibition started in **April 2019**.
   - The text on the banner in the photo matched this time frame, confirming the photo was taken in **2019**.

4. **Website Verification**:
   - I zoomed into the banner in **Google Street View** to read the URL: **http://www.tutankamon.pt**.
   - This website, although offline now, was archived on the **Wayback Machine**, where I found details confirming the website's relevance to the 2017 exhibition.

## Final Solution
- **Location**: **Centro Vasco de Gama**, Lisbon, Portugal (**38.767624째, -9.096078째**).
- **Year**: **2019**, determined through exhibition dates.
- **Website**: **[tutankamon.pt](http://www.tutankamon.pt)**, now offline, archived on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20190723003713/http://www.tutankamon.pt/).
