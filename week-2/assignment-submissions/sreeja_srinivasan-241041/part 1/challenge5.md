on using binwalk, we could extract 4 other files from megatron.png. on checking the type of file of each, we see that y0u_4r3_cl0s3.rar has been corrupted. the magic numbers had to be changed to that of a rar file, using hexed.it. now, on extracting the rar file, a pasword is asked for f1n4lly.txt. thereful we need to now analyse the other files that were present in rar.
on using sonic visualizer on purrr_2.mp3, we get "s3crtum_1s_y0ur_fr13nd", which is the password we need. the text file has a base64 encoded text, which on decoding gives us:
f0r3n51cs_ma5t3r
