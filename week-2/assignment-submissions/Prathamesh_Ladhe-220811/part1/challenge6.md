## Challenge 6
- Scanned the qr -> s
- Each block of qr contained a small qr
- Divided the original image into 29*29 parts 
- Each photo was of 300*300 pixels
- Extracted the 30*30 central pixels of each qr and enlarged it
- Each qr was 21*21, i.e. each qr corresponds to one letter or number
- But was unable to scan all the qrs properly into 841 i.e. 29*29 grid .
- Which I think would result in an encoded msg (base64 maybe ) , which would result to a flag
