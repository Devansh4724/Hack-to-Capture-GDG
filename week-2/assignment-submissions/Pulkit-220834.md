## Part 1

''' Challenge 1 : Equation
use exiftool and the flag in comment part
CTFlearn{I_Like_Math_x_y} where x and y are 
3x + 5y = 31 ; 7x + 9y = 59 ; x=2 , y=5
Flag : CTFlearn{I_Like_Math_2_5}

''' Challenge 2 : Corruption?
the file signature for gif is "47 49 46 38 39 61" and we can see the file signature of the file given to us has "39 61" so we need to add them.
we get a base64 encoded flag "ZmxhZ3tnMWZfb3JfajFmfQ==" 
Flag : flag{g1f_or_j1f}

''' Challenge 3 : Santa's Secrets
use binwalk to extract the hidden image from the "3.png" file, this will get us the original file and "1.png" is the image with noise or edited.
