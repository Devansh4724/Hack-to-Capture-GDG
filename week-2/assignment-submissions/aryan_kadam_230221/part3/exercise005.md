Well first thought which came to mind is to search zoos which are home to polar bears , and also live camera feed not being common was a thing of interest , results showed san diego zoo and after seeing some videos and live cam feed
https://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/cams/polar-cam I was sure that this is the one. With help of the rock and the green roof i was able to find the exact coordinates of the place where the bears were lying and temperature data was available as well.
#### a) San Diego Zoo ####
#### b) TEMPERATURE - ABOUT 15 deg celcius ####
#### c) COORDINATES - 32°44'04"N 117°09'16"W ####
