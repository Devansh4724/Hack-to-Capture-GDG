With the help of image we know the city's name i.e Kiffa. It is told in the tweet that the picture is taken at morning and we can see clearly the Sun is on the left side in the image , so the person taking the image must be facing the south.
If we look carefully we can see that the road is a paved one and also it kind of moves up (like a hill). There are also a bit of trees in the front so we can keep an eye on the map for it. So we are looking for a place with the above
description . I searched for the place in google earth and saw that there are only two south facing roads with some trees in their way , so i was able to find the place after some searching.
