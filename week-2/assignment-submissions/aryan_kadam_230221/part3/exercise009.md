So what i observed fromt the video was that , they mentioned that it was sunset and we can see that sun is setting in the direction at which the camera is facing , a tall brown building on the right , a plus sign on the left as the person walks down the road a bit , the road is paved and looks like a major road. So considering this i used google earth and saw that there arent many roads facing in the right direction and having many trees on the way , luckily i found the tall building as well and got the place. I checked the sunset history for Tirana for the month of February and found out that the sun was setting at around 5pm , so most probably it was taken around this time.
