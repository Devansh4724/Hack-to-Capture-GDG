### CHALLENGE 4 - NICE MUSIC ###
I checked the file signature and it was filetypeM4A but it should be ftypM4A . Even after correcting it , the file was not opening and seems that the file was corrupted. After the hint I used this to fix the file https://www.onlineconverter.com/convert/21002df64472990db36dfc482ad040bb9d. I was able to open the fixed file and got the flag.
#### FLAG - i_c4n_f1x_it ####
